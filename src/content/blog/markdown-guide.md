Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text syntax. It's widely used in README files, documentation, and online forums. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know to become a Markdown pro.

## Basic Formatting

### Headings
Headings are created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the heading level (h1 to h6).

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Bold and Italic
You can make text **bold** or *italic* using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.

```markdown
**Bold text** or __Bold text__
*Italic text* or _Italic text_
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B
```

### Ordered Lists
Use numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Links and Images

### Links
```markdown
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

### Images
Images are similar to links but start with an exclamation mark `!`.

```markdown
![Alt Text](image-url.jpg)
```

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code
Use backticks `` ` `` for inline code.

```markdown
Use the `print()` function.
```

### Fenced Code Blocks
Use three backticks ``` for multi-line code blocks. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting.

\`\`\`python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
\`\`\`

## Tables
Tables are one of the most useful but sometimes tricky features in Markdown.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

> **Pro Tip:** Use our [Markdown Table to Text Converter](/) to instantly turn your Markdown tables into ASCII text for places that don't support rich rendering!

## Blockquotes
Use `>` for blockquotes.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Horizontal Rules
Use three or more dashes `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`.

```markdown
---
```

## Conclusion
Markdown is a powerful tool for writers and developers. By mastering these simple syntax rules, you can create beautifully formatted documents in no time.
